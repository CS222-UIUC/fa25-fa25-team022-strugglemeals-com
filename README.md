# StruggleMeals.com

**CS 222 – Group 22**

StruggleMeals.com is a web application that helps college students and beginner cooks make **simple, affordable meals** using ingredients they already have at home. The platform combines ingredient-based search, budget and dietary filters, and an optional AI-powered cooking assistant to reduce the intimidation around cooking.

## 📌 Project Summary
College students often struggle to cook due to limited time, money, and experience. Many rely on repetitive or unhealthy food options because cooking feels overwhelming or inaccessible.

**StruggleMeals.com** addresses this problem by providing:
* Ingredient-based recipe search
* An optional AI chatbot that guides users step-by-step through recipes

Our goal is to make cooking **realistic, approachable, and affordable** for everyone.
